# Lyman
 Lymanâ€™s purpose is to aid in the creation of .cstruct files. These files help to parse OneDrive logs  into their components which can lead to better log decryption. By focusing on the data rather  than trying to learn how to construct these files, it becomes easier to extract data that otherwise  might be missed or misinterpreted.
